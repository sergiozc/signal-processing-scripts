# Overview
This repository contains some simulation macros related to signal processing.
The macros have been built using mainly Matlab

# Equalizer
The equalization of a QAM-16 signal transmitted through a multipath channel can be found at "equalizer/" directory.
The simulation has been carried out for a static channel (TSE-LS) and for a changing channel (TSE decision-directed).
